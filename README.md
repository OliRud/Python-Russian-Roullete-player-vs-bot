# Python-Russian-Roullete-player-vs-bot
A russian roullete script made in a python whare you compete against an AI opponent.

how to play:

spin cylander: changes the possition of the bullet in the chamber

pull trigger: shoot yourself and pass the gun to the opponent

shoot opponent: take a turn shotting the opponent but you must pull the trigger on yourself afterwards


keep in mind the opponent can perform these same actions.

Thanks for checking out my script :D
